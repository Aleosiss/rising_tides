2.3.0 LWOTC TODOS:
  ☐ Requires LWOTC PR:
    ☐ Ability to create uneditable squads
        ☐ Add `bPlayerEditable` flag to `LWGS_PersistentSquad`
        ☐ Modify `UIPersonnel_SquadBarracks` to respect this flag
            ☐ No/Disable delete squad button
            ☐ Disable rename/history/change icon buttons
            ☐ Do not allow soldier transfer/removal
    ☐ Ability for Squads to have different reasons to be unusable besides being on a mission
        ☐ Add method `LWGS_PersistentSquad.CanBeDeployed(MissionSiteState)` which triggers an event `CanLWSquadBeDeployed`
            ☐ Event Data the `XCGS_MissionSite`
            ☐ Event Source is the `LWGS_PersistentSquad` 
            ☐ TupleValue 1 is a boolean
            ☐ If Value 1 is false, Value 2 will be a localized string that contains the reason why not
        ☐ Replace usage of `IsDeployedOnMission` with `CanBeDeployed` in `UISquadListItem` and populate reason as well
        ☐ Don't know what controls the `UISquadListItem_Small`s but do the same for them there too
        ☐ Don't know what the launch squad select button is called in `UIPersonnel_SquadBarracks` but again, implement `BeCanDeployed()` there as well
  ☐ Not sure if requires a change to LWOTC
    ☐ Ability to detect when a squad is selected
        ☐ Use to restrict maximum squad size
        ☐ Use to incur strategy cost when a non-XCOM squad is used on mission
    ☐ Ability to detect what squad was used on a mission
        ☐ Use to increment Program progression after Program squad used
    ☐ Modify `EliminateFaction` to handle new LWOTC systems
        ☐ Not sure exactly what is required here
        ☐ When the Templars are eliminated, how should that be handled?
            ☐ Clean up `LWSquadManager` of Templars
            ☐ Currently progressing infiltrations should work normally, then Templars desert after the mission completes?
  ☐ Should not require a change to LWOTC
    ☐ Implement LW PR hooks
    ☐ Disable UISL_OSF
    ☐ Add a Program `LWGS_PersistentSquad` that is not `bPlayerEditable` when the faction is met
    ☐ Add infiltration modifiers to Program units/squad
    ☐ General balancing to Program Squad gear and abilities
        ☐ General balancing to enemy Templar gear and abilities
    ☐ Change Program Squad secondaries so their pistols actually go in the correct slot
    ☐ Change how the Drone schematic works to work with LW (although it's already a one-at-a-time so I'm not sure how much has to change)

2.4.0 Program Requests Patch TODOS:
  ☐ Add Program Requests System
    ☐ Add Covert Actions that grant Program Favors
    ☐ Create randomly generated narratives/costs
