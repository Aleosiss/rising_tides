2.0.0
- Added new Faction: The Program
    - Added new Strategy Cards:
        - One Small Favor: once per month, send a Program squad on a mission in place of an XCOM squad. Can't send on story missions. Guaranteed to be the first card unlocked.
            - Gain influence with the Program every 3 missions.
            - Program operatives level up after every mission, and cannot be killed or captured.
        - Just Passing Through: There is a small chance for a Program operative to join XCOM on a non-story mission.
        - Wideband Psionic Jamming: Reduce the will of enemy units by 20.
        - Old World Training: Increase the detection modifier of XCom by 20%.
        - Forty Years of War: Instantly construct Resistance Outposts.
        - Direct Neural Manipulation: Bonded Soldiers recieve bonus experience if they survive a mission together.
        - Resistance Sabotage: Other Resistance Factions gain an additional Card Slot.
    - Added new equipment (only for Program operatives)
        - Program Shadowkeeper (4-6 dmg, no Shadowfall)
        - Cosmetic Silencer (for those who like the look of the suppressors but don't like recheaters)
    - Added Encyclopedia entries for the Program
- Removed Rising Tides classes from the class decks (cannot be gained normally)
- Removed Extinction Event from Gatherer Ability Tree
    - Moved Unwilling Conduits up as replacement
    - Added Psionic Lance to fill Unwilling Conduits' spot
- Fixed several bugs related to abilities still being able to be cast after death (Psionic Storm, Six Paths of Pain)
- Swapped the position of Six Paths of Pain and Knowledge of Power on Gatherer Ability Tree
- Scoped And Dropped now triggers off of kills made by pistols and Kubikuri
- Added a range limit to Mind Wrack (6 tiles)
- Fixed several bugs related to how the Meld applies its stats
- Added a small will recovery to Guardian Angel
- Guardian Angel now affects the caster

1.1.2

- enabled WOTC class features such as bonding
- made nearly every psionic ability interruptible (if you notice one that isn't, post it in the bugs discussion)
- Sovereign actually works now, because of this.
- fixed an issue where Feedback wasn't being applied properly
- possibly some other random tweaks

1.1.1

- removed X2MeleePathingPawn override (should be fully compatible with Gotcha)
- let Ghosts (Gatherer and Berserker) Headshot The Lost (Infiltrator already does this by default)
- removed accidentally-included debugging loadouts (this is why they started with endgame armor/weapons)
