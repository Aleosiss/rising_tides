## Rising Tides Mod for XCOM2.

Rising Tides (henceforth "RTMod") is an XCOM 2 content addition mod that aims to provide a DLC-like experience. Currently I looking to provide the following functionality:

>- Three "hero"-type units, each with unique three-branch skill trees
>- A single Ghost "superclass" extension (as Soldier is to the Vanilla classes) which provides the following:

>  -> Additional mobility options ("Icarus"-style vertical mobility, fall damage negation)

>  -> Additional default abilities ("Mind Control", "Mind Wrack", "Mind Meld", "Reflection")

>  -> Shared abilities across child classes ("Teek", "Vital Point Targeting", "Fade")

>- Special narrative missions to use these units in a controlled environment to ease balancing in a mod-rich environment

This would be a bare-bones content mod. I also have the following content in mind, but would be out of my current capability to do alone (IE I would either need to develop the skills and/or obtain additional contributors, either volunteers or contractors):

>- Voicework for each individual hero unit, as well as other characters 
>- New models/animations for armor, weapons, and map assets (and possibly faces)
>- High-quality 2D artwork (Producing Icons is possible ATM, but not much more)

###### Current TODOs:  
              - Tidy up current code
              - Time Stop ability
