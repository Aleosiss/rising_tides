> Rising Tides is an XCOM 2 WOTC Faction mod. It adds the Program, an illusive organization that has aided XCOM in the past, to the game.

The Program is an organization with a long history dating back deep into the old world. Unlike other factions available in the vanilla experience, the Program will not work as closely with XCOM, and will not commit their own to work with XCOM directly. Instead, once a month, you can call in a favor, and have the Program run a mission for you. If you gain enough influence via these favors, the Program will entrust upon you a task of monumental importance to society at large and rewards in kind.
