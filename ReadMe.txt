Rising Tides is a small class pack. My initial idea was to create a small cadre of soldiers who were primarily balanced around the strategic layer... however, due to life, I never had the time to actually implement the strategic layer part of this mod, so, yeah...

You can consider all of these soldiers to be hero classes; each is incredibly overpowered, and a pair of them can easily defeat almost anything XCOM2 has to offer.

[h1]The soldiers are as follows: [/h1]

[b]Queen[/b], a stealthy melee assassin, who lives for the thrill of battle. Her Squaddie perk is [b]Bump in the Night[/b], which grants [b]Stealth[/b] after killing a nearby enemy. Additionally, it grants a stack of [b]Bloodlust[/b] if it was a melee kill.

[b]Whisper[/b], a long-ranged damage dealer and technical expert. His squaddie perk is [b]Scoped and Dropped[/b], which negates the distance penalty for squadsight and negates the action point cost of his shots if they kill exposed targets.

[b]Nova[/b], a psionic support and caster. Her squaddie perk is [b]Over the Shoulder[/b], an active ability that, when cast, creates a massive aura that surrounds her and grants vision of enemy units that are within it.

With War of the Chosen coming out soon, I realized that Firaxis and I had found similar inspiration for many of our ideas, and so I needed to get my project out the door quickly. With that in mind, following the annoucement, I worked hard to bring this mod to a release candiate, and here we are. You will notice that there is an uncanny similarity between each of my classes and the Chosen! I WAS FIRST, DAMNIT!!!

However, this mod fell to the wayside somewhere around the fall of 2016, so I never got around to working on the strategy layer. I will be sure to get around to it soon!
