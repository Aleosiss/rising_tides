Rising Tides Mod for XCOM2.

Rising Tides (henceforth "RTMod") is an XCOM 2 content addition mod that aims to provide a DLC-like experience. Currently I looking to provide the following functionality:

- Three "hero"-type units, each with unique three-branch skill trees
- A single Ghost "superclass" extension (as Soldier is to the Vanilla classes) which provides the following:
  -> Additional mobility options ("Icarus"-style vertical mobility, fall damage negation)
  -> Additional default abilities ("Mind Control", "Mind Wrack", "Mind Meld", "Reflection")
  -> Shared abilities across child classes ("Teek", "Vital Point Targeting", "Fade")
-
