Rising Tides is a small class pack. My initial idea was to create a small cadre of soldiers who were primarily balanced around the strategic layer... however, due to life, I never had the time to actually implement the strategic layer part of this mod. Oops.

You can consider all of these soldiers to be hero classes; each is incredibly overpowered, and at the later ranks, a pair of them can easily defeat almost anything XCOM2 has to offer. All of them are psionic hybrid classes, and do not hold the Psi Amp. As such, they all share a suite of psionic abilities, including familiar perks like Mind Control, but also new and powerful perks such as [b] Meld[/b] and [b] Mind Wrack[/b].

[b]Meld[/b]: The Meld is a psionic gestalt the Rising Tides soldiers can form with one another. Under the influence of the meld, soldiers pool their Psi Offense and Will stats together. Many perks in the soldiers trees interact with the meld, and losing it can be a serious problem. The Meld can be lost by entering a negative mental state, such as excessive bloodlust, panic, or feedback.

[b] Mind Wrack [/b]: Instantly kill an enemy organic unit within range and line of sight. Suffer [b]Feedback[/b] for a significant duration, during which the unit cannot take any actions.

[h1]The soldiers are as follows: [/h1]

[b]Queen[/b], a stealthy melee assassin. Her Squaddie perk is [b]Bump in the Night[/b], which grants [b]Stealth[/b] after killing a nearby enemy. Additionally, it grants a stack of [b]Bloodlust[/b] if it was a melee kill. Notable non-capstone perks on her tree include [b] Reprobate Waltz[/b], which grants her a chance to repeat any melee attack, and [b] Shadow Strike[/b], a true melee teleport attack.

[b]Whisper[/b], a long-ranged damage dealer and technical expert. His squaddie perk is [b]Scoped and Dropped[/b], which negates the distance penalty for squadsight and negates the action point cost of his shots if they kill exposed targets. Notable non-capstone perks on his tree include [b] Every Moment Matters[/b], which gives him a guaranteed Critical Hit on the last bullet in his magazine, and [b] Heat Channel[/b], which allows him to reload his weapon for free when using a psionic ability, as well as reducing the cooldown of the casted ability by one for each bullet reloaded. 

[b]Nova[/b], a psionic support unit and caster. Her squaddie perk is [b]Over the Shoulder[/b], an active ability that, when cast, creates a massive aura that surrounds her and grants vision of enemy units that are within it. Notable non-capstone perks on her tree include [b] Sovereign[/b], which allows her to interrupt any psionic attack made by a unit affected by Over the Shoulder, and [b] Triangulation[/b], which allows her to cast Over the Shoulder from melded allies.

With War of the Chosen coming out soon, I realized that Firaxis and I had found similar inspiration for many of our ideas, and so I needed to get my project out the door quickly. With that in mind, following the announcement, I worked hard to bring this mod to a release candidate, and here we are. You will notice that there is an uncanny similarity between each of my classes and the Chosen! I WAS FIRST, DAMNIT!!!

However, this mod fell to the wayside somewhere around the fall of 2016, so I never got around to working on the strategy layer. I will be sure to get around to it soon!

[h1] FAQ [/h1]

[b] Compatibility? [/b]
Long War technically isn't required. Several things will go wrong if you run without it. Queen and Whisper will be missing perks, and you won't be able to access any of their full perk trees (including the monumental tree capstones!). Alternatively, you could use Musashi's LW2 Promotion Screen port. 

[b]Time Stands Still[/b] will mostly function, but it will not be able to adjust the timer without LW2.

Finally, and this is a big finally, [b] I override [i]X2MeleePathingPawn[/i][/b]. From what I can tell, this messes with [b]Gotcha Again[/b], which is potentially a big deal. You'll be missing out on a few aspects of that mod; Try to load it first, then this. [b]Shadow Strike[/b] will probably not work. I didn't experience crashes, but it's still probably safer to not take the perk.

[b] What's going on with Queen's Melee Damage? Not getting adjusted by her equiped weapon, overpowered early...? [/b]
It can only be adjusted by config. Originally, Queen had a unique blade, but eventually that got dropped.

[b] Why do so many perks have the sword slash icon?[/b]
It's a placeholder. Basically, I'm not an artist and as stated previously, I wanted to get this out there ASAP. If you are interested in helping me out with the art, please send me a mesage on Steam and we can work something out.

[b] WTF, these classes are so OP! [/b]
By design. In the future, they will be limited in the following ways: 
- Only one of each
- Only can be in a squad with each other
- Significant intel cost to send on a mission

[b] I looked at the source. What is your IQ, 3?[/b]

[b] Your references are cringey. [/b]
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
